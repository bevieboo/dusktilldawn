##Dusk till dawn

This is a project aimed to help users searching for events selected by music type happening in Melbourne.
There are few ways you can look for events: through the search-bar, inserting the kind of music you prefer, o looking for your favorite bar/clubs and see if they have anything interesting going on.
It shows users also a map to check how far it is the place, where the event is gonna happen , from their position.

Owner's clubs/bar have their own access to the website so they can manage their own venue and organise their own event.

##Languages and gems

There have been installed different gem to facilitate the execution of the codes:
Geocoder to integrate automatically latitude and logitude to our venues table, so we could use it for a better application of the google map,
 and pickaday, a Javascript Datepicker.

The languages that have been used in this project are ruby on rails for the backend, and mainly javascript(libraries as jquery and handlebars included) HTML and SASS.
No framework have been used, everything is pure CSS.
